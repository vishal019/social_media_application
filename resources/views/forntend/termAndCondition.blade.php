<li><strong><strong> Our On-boarding Processes</strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Creators</strong></strong><br />To ensure safety and compliance, our onboarding process for Creators at <a href="https://www.qoeens.com/"><u>https://www.qoeens.com/</u></a>&nbsp;includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifying that Creators are at least 18 years old and confirming their identity.</li>
<li>Collecting Creator User Data (Section 8) and Financial Data to process payments, earnings, and to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>Verifying country of residence to ensure lawful access to the platform.</li>
<li>Requiring a third-party age and identity verification process.</li>
<li>Ensuring no prior bans for Terms of Service violations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Content Collaborators</strong></strong> <br />Content Collaborators must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be at least 18 years old and verify their identity through a third-party process.</li>
<li>Submit a release form when required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Fans</strong></strong><br />The on-boarding process for Fans ensures they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are at least 18 years old, with age verification required in specific circumstances or locations.</li>
<li>Provide Fan User Data and Financial Data (Section 8) for payments and anti-fraud measures.</li>
<li>Complete third-party age verification or estimation processes as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Third-Party Age and Identity Verification</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party providers verify age and identity using a "selfie" and government-issued photo ID, matched via Face Recognition Data.</li>
<li>Face Recognition Data is handled exclusively by third-party providers; we only retain the results.</li>
<li>This process enhances fraud prevention and maintains platform security.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Third-Party Age Estimation</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For certain regions, age estimation is performed using digital analysis of a "selfie."</li>
<li>Results (pass/fail) are recorded, and failed users may opt for full age and identity verification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Periodic Authentication</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic re-verification may be required during account tenure.</li>
<li>Users can withdraw consent for Face Recognition Data retention by contacting privacy@qoeens.com, but may need to resubmit ID for future authentications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Why Third-Party Face Recognition?</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensures safety, compliance, and fraud prevention, reducing risks of fake documents or spoofing.</li>
<li>Records of failed attempts are maintained to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
